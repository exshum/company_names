Ever wanted to name your super new startup, but ran out of ideas?

company_names can help you!


On the command-line, run:

    $ python generate_names.py <sample file> [<more samples> ...]

You'll get three columns of generated names, with each column having
more order (i.e. closer to the original sample(s)) than one to its
left.

A sample dictionary (words.txt) is included, but the Internet is
full of lexicons on all sorts of topics:  technical terms, mythology,
literary, etc.  Just download the ones you like and add them to the
command line.

Names are generated by Markov chains on 2-, 3- and 4-gram graphs
trained on the input samples.

Enjoy!
